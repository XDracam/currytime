![Lambda man](lambda_man_scaled.jpg)

### A pure functional Programming Language

  * Everything immutable
  * Everything is lazy
  * Everything is a function
  * Everything is awesome

## Getting started

### Tools

  * GHC - The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
  * A mature editor (e.g. vim, VSCode)
  * REPL-Integration (e.g. vim-slime for vim users)

### Soak, Wash, Rinse, Repeat - The REPL

## Purity

### What is a Side Effect?

* variable assignment
* displaying something
* printing to console

### Purity - No Side Effects

[columns]

[column=0.6]

* Haskell is **pure** - no side effects
\smallskip
* `=` is mathematical equality
\smallskip
* Purity leads to **referential transparency**: for every `x = expr` you can replace `x` with `expr` without changing semantics
\smallskip
* An expression `f x` is **pure** if it is referentially transparent for every referentially transparent `x`

[column=0.4]

![State - you're doing it wrong](statewrong.jpg)

[/columns]

## Referential Transparency

### Referential Transparency - Example

Not referentially transparent: \
Successive calls to `count()` return different values.

\smallskip

```c
int counter = 0;
int count() { return ++counter; }

int x = count();

int a, b;
a = x; b = x; // a == b == 1
a = count(); b = count(); // a == 2, b == 3
```

**Pure functions do not modify any state. **\
**They always return the same result given the same input.**

## Lazyness

### Lazyness

... not today

### Lazyness

* Eager evaluation: expression is evaluated as soon as it is used
* Lazy evaluation: expression is only evaluated when it is needed

\smallskip

```java
int counter = 0;
private int count() { return ++counter; }
```

```java
int foo = Optional.of(1337).orElse(count()); 
// Eager: foo == 1337; counter == 1;
```

```java
int foo = Optional.of(1337).orElseGet(() -> count());
// Lazy: foo == 1337; counter == 0;
```

**Everything in Haskell is evaluated lazily.**

# Functions

## Basics

### Basic Syntax

```haskell
sum :: Num a => a -> a -> a
sum x y = x + y
```
```haskell
-- type declarations can be omitted
times2 a = a `sum` a
```
```haskell
abs :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> a
abs x = if x < 0 then -x else x
```
```haskell
compareTo :: (Num a, Ord a1) => a1 -> a1 -> a
compareTo x y 
  | x > y = 1
  | x < y = -1
  | otherwise = 0
```

## More on Functions

### Currying

All functions take a single argument and return a single value

```haskell
sum :: Num a => a -> a -> a
sum x y = x + y
```
```haskell
addTwo :: Num a => a -> a
addTwo = sum 2
```

`sum` is a **curried** function: it takes a number `x` and returns a function that takes a number `y` that returns the sum of `x` and `y`

```haskell
-- (x +) :: a -> a
sum' :: Num a => a -> a -> a
sum' x = (x +)
```

### Higher order Functions & Lambdas

* A **higher order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument
* A **lambda expression** is an anonymous closure with syntax  
  `\arg arg2 ... -> expression`

\bigskip

```haskell
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)
flip f = \x y -> f y x
```
```haskell
negate :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
negate p = not . p
```

# Types

## Basic Types

### 

???

## Lists

### Creating Lists

```haskell
favoritePrimes :: [Int]
favoritePrimes = [3,7,9,11]
```
```haskell
evenNumbers = [x | x <- [0..50], x `mod` 2 == 0]
evenNumbers' = [0,2..50]
evenNumbersAndOne = 1 : evenNumbers
```
```haskell
alphabet = ['a'..'z'] ++ ['A' .. 'Z']
```

### Basic list functions

```haskell
head [1, 2, 3] --> 1
tail [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 3]
init [1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2]
last [1, 2, 3] --> 3
```
```haskell
take 2 [1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2]
takeWhile (< 3) [1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2]
```
```haskell
drop 2 [1, 2, 3] --> [3]
dropWhile (< 3) [1, 2, 3] --> [3]
```

### More on Lists

```haskell
zip ['a', 'b'] [1..] --> [('a',1), ('b', 2)]
zipWith (+) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] --> [5, 7, 9]
```
```haskell
map abs [-1, -2, 3] --> [1, 2, 3]
filter even [1, 2, 3, 4] --> [2, 4]
any even [3, 5, 7] --> False
```
```haskell
cycle [1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...]
repeat 'g' --> "ggggggggggggggggggg..."
```
Due to lazy evaluation we can have infinite lists.  
Don't run `length` on this. It takes forever.

### Folds - Formally known as Reducers

`foldl` accumulates a *sequence* into a value *left to right*
```haskell
foldl :: Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
foldl (+) 0 [1..5]
```
```hs
foldl (+)     (0 + 1)                     [2..5]
foldl (+)    ((0 + 1) + 2)                [3..5]
foldl (+)   (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)           [4, 5]
foldl (+)  ((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4)      [5]
foldl (+) (((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5) []
```

### Folds - Formally known as Reducers

`foldr` accumulates a *sequence* into a value *right to left*
```haskell
foldr :: Foldable t => (b -> b -> a) -> b -> t a -> b
foldr (+) 0 [1..5]
```
```hs
(1 +                     (foldr (+) 0 [2..5]))
(1 + (2 +                (foldr (+) 0 [3..5])))
(1 + (2 + (3 +           (foldr (+) 0 [4, 5]))))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 +      (foldr (+) 0 [5]   )))))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + (foldr (+) 0 []    ))))))
```

### An Example - FizzBuzz

```haskell
fizzBuzz = zipWith stringify [1..] fizzBuzzes
  where
    stringify num "" = show num
    stringify _ str = str
    fizzBuzzes = zipWith (++) fizzes buzzes
		-- ["", "", "Fizz", "", "Buzz", "Fizz",...]
    fizzes = cycle ["", "", "Fizz"]
    buzzes = cycle ["", "", "", "", "Buzz"]

["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz"...]
```

### Another Example - The Fibonnacci Sequence

A non-tailrecursive implementation
```hs
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```
A tailrecursive implementation
```hs
fib = 1:1:(zipWith (+) fib (tail fib))

1:1:(zipWith (+) 1:1:(...) 1:(...))
1:1:2:(zipWith (+) 1:2:(...) 2:(...))
1:1:2:3:(zipWith (+) 2:3:(...) 3:(...))
```

## Custom Data Types

### Sum Types

Sum types are essentially represented as `enum`s in C-like languages

\smallskip

```haskell
data BracketValidationResult
  = TooManyOpen
  | TooManyClosed
  | Fine
  | NoCode
```

### Product Types

Product types are essentially `struct`s in C

\smallskip

```haskell
data Tape = Tape [Int] Int [Int] 
tape = Tape [1, 2] 3 [4]
left  (Tape l _ _) = l
right (Tape _ _ r) = r
curr  (Tape _ c _) = c
```
```haskell
-- record syntax
data Tape = Tape
  { left :: [Int], curr :: Int, right :: [Int] } 
tape  = Tape [1, 2] 3 [4]
tape' = Tape {left = [1, 2], curr = 3, right = [4]}
```

### Mix and Match

```haskell
data Point =
  Point Float
        Float
  deriving (Show)
```
```haskell
data Shape
  = Circle { center :: Point
           , radius :: Float }
  | Rectangle { upperLeft :: Point
              , lowerRight :: Point }
  deriving (Show)
```

## Type Classes

### Type Clases 1

Type classes are used to 'implement' an interface for a type

\smallskip

```haskell
class Eq a where
    (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    x /= y = not (x == y)
    x == y = not (x /= y)
```

Implementing `Eq` for a type `T` makes the type magically work for every function that expects an instance of `Eq`

\smallskip

```haskell
instance Eq Tape where
  x == y = 
    left x == left y 
    && curr x == curr y 
    && right x == right y
```

### Type Classes 2

Type class instances can be derived from a type:

```haskell
data Tape = Tape [Int] Int [Int] deriving (Eq, Show)
```

Type classes itself can derive from other type classes:

```haskell
class (Eq a) => Num a where ...
```

Builtin useful type classes:

## Pattern matching

### Pattern matching: Simple case

```haskell
fib 1 = 1
fib 2 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```

```haskell
fib n = case n of 
  1 -> 1
  2 -> 1
  n -> fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```

### Pattern Matching: Deconstruction

```haskell
partition :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (p:xs) = (quicksort lesser) 
    ++ [p] 
    ++ (quicksort greater)
    where (lesser, greater) = partition (< p) xs
```

### Pattern Matching: Deconstruction

```haskell
-- without overflow management
increment :: Tape -> Tape
```

```haskell
data Tape = Tape [Int] Int [Int]
increment (Tape left curr right) = 
    Tape left (curr + 1) right
```

```haskell
data Tape =
  Tape { left :: [Int], curr :: Int, right :: [Int] }
increment Tape
  { left = l
  , curr = c
  , right = r
  } = Tape l (c + 1) r
```

# Brainfuck

## Basics

### What is Brainfuck?

* Tape with cells holding a single byte each
* A pointer to a cell can be moved left and right
* The value of the cell can be incremented and decremented

| Comment | Description                                                 |
|:-------:|:------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `>`    | Move the pointer to the right                               |
|  `<`	  | Move the pointer to the left                                |
|  `+`	  | Increment the memory cell under the pointer                 |
|  `-`	  | Decrement the memory cell under the pointer                 |
|  `.`	  | Output the character signified by the cell at the pointer   |
|  `,`	  | Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer   |
|  `[`	  | Jump past the matching `]` if the cell is 0                 |
|  `]`	  | Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell is nonzero        |

## Dealing with Side Effects

### Dealing with Side Effects

* Haskell is **pure**: There are no side effects
* But every program interacts with its environment in some way
* The `IO` monad *describes* an interaction with the environment
* Descriptions can be *composed* through the *bind* operator `>>=`
* The `main` function in Haskell returns an `IO ()` which describes the sum of all side effects to be executed by the Haskell runtime

### Simulating imperative programming

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
```

```haskell
getLine >>= (\firstLine -> 
  getLine >>= (\secondLine -> 
    putStrLine (firstLine ++ secondLine)
      >> putStrLine "Done."))
```

```haskell
do
  firstLine <- getLine 
  secondLine <- getLine
  putStrLine $ firstLine ++ secondLine
  putStrLine "Done."
```

### IO - Example

`getLine` yields an `IO String` which describes how to *later* yield a string by executing controlled side effects:

\bigskip

```haskell
takeLinesUntil :: (String -> Bool) -> IO [String]
takeLinesUntil predicate = go predicate []
  where
    go predicate lines = do
      line <- getLine
      if predicate line
        then return $ reverse lines
        else go predicate $ line : lines
```

### 

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  putStrLn "\nEnter code and input:\n"
  codeLines <- takeLinesUntil null
  let singleLineCode = intercalate "" codeLines
  let (code, input) = parseInput singleLineCode
  case validateBrackets code of
    TooManyOpen -> putStrLn tooManyOpenError
    TooManyClosed -> putStrLn tooManyClosedError
    NoCode -> putStrLn noCodeError
    Fine -> do
      let out = interpretCode code input
      putStrLn "Output:\n"
      putStrLn out
```
